The project was accepted in this state therefore I won't be working on it anymore as I have to move on with other tasks.

# What remained to be done: #

  The webshop is not fully functional since it was made with the idea of a separate Admin page is to be added later.
  This Admin page would handle incoming orders, communication with customers, some inventory management and making discounts.

  The page was made with my 1366x768 laptop screen and while I made it somewhat flexible 
  - by using percentages in css everywhere I could - there is no guarantee it will look good on any resolution.
  This wasn't a priority.
